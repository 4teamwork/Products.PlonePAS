Changelog
=========

4.0 - Unreleased
----------------

- Removed half-done ZCacheable caching for users and groups.
  [hannosch]

  [hannosch]

- Removed a dependency on CMFPlone's `_createObjectByType` method.
  [hannosch]

  can use the `notifyMemberAreaCreated` hook for any kind of custom behavior.
  [hannosch]

- Moved the `scale_image` function from CMFPlone.utils into our own utils
  module, as we are the only user of it. Also made the tests independent of

  [hannosch]

- Removed support for group workspaces. This part from GRUF hasn't been
  supported for many releases anymore.
  [hannosch]

  officially GRUF-dependency-free :)
  [hannosch]

- Merged all code for the group data tool from GRUF into this package.
  [hannosch]

- Removed the GRUFBridge plugin. PAS inside GRUF isn't supported anymore.
  [hannosch]

  tests and normalized file names.
  [hannosch]

  functions following Plone.
  [hannosch]

- Copied setLoginFormInCookieAuth from CMFPlone migrations.
  [hannosch]

- Removed five:deprecatedManageAddDelete directives for
  Products.PluggableAuthService as this is now done in that
  package already (which would conflict with our zcml).
  [maurits]

- Purged old Zope 2 Interface interfaces for Zope 2.12 compatibility.
  (only a test in this case)
  [elro]


3.8 - UNRELEASED
----------------

- Fixed our OrderedDict to be unpickable with pickle protocol 2. On
  unpickling a __init__ method is not called and an optimization in
  protocol 2 would call __setitem__ without the _list to be initialized.
  Even using a __getstate__ / __setstate__ combination wouldn't work
  around that. This change was found in using membrane and
  MemcachedManager.
  [hannosch, tesdal]


3.6 - June 25, 2008
-------------------

- Modify PloneGroup.getMemberIds to use all IGroupIntrospection plugins
  to get the group members. This makes it possible to list members in
  an LDAP group.
  [wichert]


3.5 - June 25, 2008
-------------------

- Make PASSearchView.merge actually merge search results. Its previous
  behaviour was quite nasty: it preferred search results from the
  enumeration plugin with the lowest priority!
  [wichert]


3.4 - March 26, 2008
--------------------

- Added BBB code for changed setLoginFormInCookieAuth upgrade method.
  [hannosch]

- Ignore but log users without passwords during migration from pre-PAS, as
  these cannot be added to any standard user source.
  [hannosch]

- Fix listRoleInfo on the role plugin to also lazily update the list
  of portal roles.
  [wichert]


3.3 - March 7, 2007
-------------------

- Added metadata.xml file to the profile.
  [hannosch]

- Improve handing of sorting for searches.
  [csenger]

- Updating the roles for a group did not invalidate the _findGroup cache.
  [wichert]

- Fixed some tool icons to point to existing icons.
  [hannosch]


3.0 - August 16, 2007
---------------------

- Fix check for authenticateCredentials return value
 [rossp]


3.0rc2 - July 27, 2007
----------------------

- Fake a getPhysicalPath on our search view so ZCacheing works properly
  everywhere.
  [wichert]

- Add event classes for logged-in and logged-out events.
  [wichert]


3.0rc1 - July 8, 2007
---------------------

- Correct logic in MemberData capability methods: any plugin is
  allowed to (re)set a password, delete the user or add roles. 
  [wichert]

- Use the proper API to get the containing PAS in the group plugin
  [wichert]

- Fix setting user properties on the user object.
  [wichert]


3.0b7 - May 5, 2007
-------------------

- Removed the five:registerPackage statement again. It causes problems in a
  ZEO environment.
  [hannosch]

- Removed our version of the Plone tool from ToolInit. It won't get an icon
  anymore and you cannot add it, but existing instances still work. We
  migrate all instances back to the regular tool anyways.
  [hannosch]


3.0b6 - May 5, 2007
-------------------

- Fixed two migration related test failures.
  [hannosch]

- Spring cleaning, removed some cruft, pyflaked and corrected some more
  undefined names.
  [hannosch]

- New package layout, following standard Python package conventions.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed tool names in ToolInit, so the permission has a proper name. This
  closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/6525.
  [hannosch]


3.0-beta5 - May 2, 2007
-----------------------

- Modify the roles plugin to lazily update its roles list from the portal.
  [wichert]

- Filter duplicate search results.
  [laz, wichert]

- Add a sort_by option to the search methods to allow sorting of results
  by a property. 
  [laz, wichert]

- Modify login method for the cookie plugin to perform the credential
  update in the PAS of the user instead of the PAS of the plugin. This
  helps in making sure that users will only authenticate against their
  own user folder, so we get all their roles, properties, etc. correctly.
  [wichert]

- Update installation logic to use plone.session for cookies
  [wichert]

- Add pas_info and pas_search browser views.
  [wichert]

- Deprecate the PlonePAS PloneTool; its changes have been merged in the
  standard Plone version.
  [wichert]

- Use getUtility to get the portal object.
  [wichert]

- Deprecate user and group searching through CMF member and group tools
  in favour of PAS enumeration.
  [wichert]

- Refactor user searching in the membership tool to use standard PAS
  searches.
  [wichert]

- Add user enumeration capabilities to the mutable properties plugin.
  [wichert]

- Add a new automatic group plugin which puts all users in a virtual
  group. This is useful for permissions handling: since it is not
  possible to add roles to users with the Authenticated role a
  virtual group can be used instead.
  [wichert]

- Added support to import PloneUserFactory and added stub 
  for ZODBMutableProperties. Attention: Latter needs a real
  export and import! At the moment it do not export the 
  propertysheets. This is a TODO. At least with this two 
  additions PlonePAS import runs. Additional I needed to
  hack PluginRegistry and and PluggableAuthService slightly.      
  [jensens]
  
- Added HISTORY.txt and updated version information.
  [hannosch]


2.4 - April 15, 2007
--------------------

- Optomise the local roles plugin for the common case where
  local_roles is empty
  [dreamcatcher]

- the plone user was assuming a one to one mapping between property plugin
  and user property sheet, and stripping away additional ones as part of
  the retrieval of ordered sheets, instead, it now stores all
  propertysheets in an ordered dictionary, so this assumption is not needed
  [k_vertigo]

- More postonly security changes
  [alecm, ramon]


2.3 - May 30, 2007
------------------

- Use a local postonly decorator so PlonePAS can be used with Plone 
  2.5, 2.5.1 and 2.5.2.
  [wichert]

- Protect the tools with postonly security modifiers.
  [mj]

- Update GRUF compatibility functions to use the same security checks
  as GRUF itself uses.
  [mj]

- Fix migration to handle properties of selection or multiple selection
  types.
  [reinout]

- Correct creation of groups wich default group managers.
  [dreamcatcher]

- Fix migration from GRUF sites: also include the member properties in the
  migration.
  [tesdal]

- Correct the test for creation of groups with the same id as users: search
  for the exact id, not substrings.
  [tesdal]
  
- Fix bad form action which made it impossible to add a plone user factory
  plugin through the ZMI. Backported from trunk.
  [wichert]
