PlonePAS 2.5 - Unreleased

    - Check if the portal_groups tool is presend in our PAS monkeys.
      [wichert]

    - membership tool search mechanism now passes all arguments
      specified in the pas enumeration plugin interface to the
      underlying plugin. 
      [k_vertigo]

    - membership tool member search now respects sorted results from a
      pas user enumeration plugin.
      [k_vertigo]

PlonePAS 2.4 - April 15, 2007

    - Optomise the local roles plugin for the common case where
      local_roles is empty
      [dreamcatcher]

    - the plone user was assuming a one to one mapping between property plugin
      and user property sheet, and stripping away additional ones as part of
      the retrieval of ordered sheets, instead, it now stores all
      propertysheets in an ordered dictionary, so this assumption is not needed
      [k_vertigo]

    - More postonly security changes
      [alecm, ramon]
      

PlonePAS 2.3 - March 30, 2007

    - Use a local postonly decorator so PlonePAS can be used with Plone 
      2.5, 2.5.1 and 2.5.2.
      [wichert]

    - Protect the tools with postonly security modifiers.
      [mj]

    - Update GRUF compatibility functions to use the same security checks
      as GRUF itself uses.
      [mj]

    - Fix migration to handle properties of selection or multiple selection
      types.
      [reinout]

    - Correct creation of groups wich default group managers.
      [dreamcatcher]

    - Fix migration from GRUF sites: also include the member properties in the
      migration.
      [tesdal]

    - Correct the test for creation of groups with the same id as users: search
      for the exact id, not substrings.
      [tesdal]
      
    - Fix bad form action which made it impossible to add a plone user factory
      plugin through the ZMI. Backported from trunk.
      [wichert]
