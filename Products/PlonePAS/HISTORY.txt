Changelog for PlonePAS

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

PlonePAS 3.0.0 - Unreleased

    _ Add pas_info and pas_search browsr views.
      [wichert]

    - Deprecate the PlonePAS PloneTool; its changes have been merged in the
      standard Plone version.
      [wichert]

    - Use getUtility instead of getToolByName. Use direct attribute access
      in the install and migration code to work around utility lookup caching
      returning older versions of tools.
      [wichert]

    - Deprecate user and group searching through CMF member and group tools
      in favour of PAS enumeration.
      [wichert]

    - Refactor user searching in the membership tool to use standard PAS
      searches.
      [wichert]

    - Add user enumeration capabilities to the mutable properties plugin.
      [wichert]

    - Add a new automatic group plugin which puts all users in a virtual
      group. This is useful for permissions handling: since it is not
      possible to add roles to users with the Authenticated role a
      virtual group can be used instead.
      [wichert]

    - Added support to import PloneUserFactory and added stub 
      for ZODBMutableProperties. Attention: Latter needs a real
      export and import! At the moment it do not export the 
      propertysheets. This is a TODO. At least with this two 
      additions PlonePAS import runs. Additional I needed to
      hack PluginRegistry and and PluggableAuthService slightly.      
      [jensens]
      
    - Added HISTORY.txt and updated version information.
