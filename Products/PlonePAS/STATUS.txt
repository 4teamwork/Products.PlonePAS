PlonePAS is still very much in development. Most of it works at the moment, but deployment
on production sites is highly discouraged. If you are interested, please install and test
on a development system. Help us work out the bugs! See below for specific notes.

PlonePAS currently works with all Plone UI functionality except for password reset.
If you wish to use PlonePAS, you should install PasswordResetTool.

PlonePAS implements a good deal of the API expected of a UserFolder and of GRUF. However,
no systematic determination of interface fulfillment has been made, beyond that used by the
UI. If you find something missing that is needed, please report.

PlonePAS will currently migrate the users and groups of a default Plone setup. Other setups may work.
Please see the README.

Using GRUF as a multi-source may work, but hasn't been looked at recently.

Using LDAPMultiPlugins will work.

MembershipTool role mapping is currently broken. See README.
