PlonePAS is still in development. Most of it works at the
moment, but you should be very cautious about deployment on production
sites and do serious testing. If you are interested, please
install and test on a development system. Help us work out the bugs!
See below for specific notes.

PlonePAS currently works with all Plone UI functionality except for
password reset.  If you wish to use PlonePAS, you should install
PasswordResetTool.

Some Plone UI functionality will not work with all plugins.
LDAPMultiPlugin, for example, cannot list users; many plugins
cannot modify users/properties/groups/etc. There is some capabilities
checking now, so that things that cannot be changed will not appear
changable.

PlonePAS implements a good deal of the API expected of a UserFolder
and of GRUF. However, no systematic determination of interface
fulfillment has been made, beyond that used by the Plone UI. If you find
something missing that is needed, please report.

PlonePAS will currently migrate the users and groups of a default
Plone setup. Other setups may work.  Please see the README.

Using GRUF as a multi-source may work, but hasn't been looked at
recently.

PlonePAS will also migrate existing LDAPUserFolder+GRUF setups. It
will use the ADMultiPlugin by default: there's no LDAP/AD detection yet.

Please also see the README and NOTES.
