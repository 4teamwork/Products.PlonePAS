Password reset

Write tests for adding, setting, deleting properties on users.

Write tests checking function of global roles (users and groups) and local roles (users and groups).

Write tests to groups tool.

Verify why user records just created are marked as "orphaned" in portal_memberdata. It could just be that they never logged in.

PlonePAS groups tool: assure API implementation; move common bits into Plone GroupsTool, also interface

PlonePAS ZODBMutableProperties plugin not installed

Group properties support in PAS (a plugin, not the GroupData properties)?

Should probably define group factory plugin

I don't like where prefs_group_details form ends up. Should go back to prefs_group_members or itself. But,
this is not a regression.

Plone should include GroupData in its GroupDataTool.py. After this, our GroupData or monkey-patch can use the Plone one.

jcc:

 - PasswordResetTool needed for reset password thing

 - password reset and deletion UI needs to be determined by availability of plugins

 - does title not get to wrapped group
