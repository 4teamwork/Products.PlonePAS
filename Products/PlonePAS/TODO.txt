Password reset

Write tests for adding, setting, deleting properties on users.

Write tests checking function of global roles (users and groups) and local roles (users and groups).

Write tests to groups tool.

Write test to make sure we're not using a name mangling version.

Verify why user records just created are marked as "orphaned" in portal_memberdata. It could just be that they never logged in.

Make sure local roles searching works.

PlonePAS groups tool: assure API implementation; move common bits into Plone GroupsTool, also interface

Should groups.getGroupById use new acl_users.getGroup?

Group properties support in PAS (a plugin, not the GroupData properties)?

Should probably define group factory plugin

I don't like where prefs_group_details form ends up. Should go back to prefs_group_members or itself. But,
this is not a regression.

Plone should include GroupData in its GroupDataTool.py. After this, our GroupData or monkey-patch can use the Plone one.
Relatedly, wrapUsers and wrapGroups should have a way of specifying the wrapping object so it's easier to over-ride.

We're dependent on GRUF for groups tools. 

PAS.plugins.ZODBGroupManager.removeGroup tries to remove every user from group. Probably bad!

_doChangeGroup ignores groups to add. This doesn't bother Plone.

hooked up ZODBMutableProperties plugin schema to MemberData properties. Should probably note that other plugins
may not do this. also: do we want another schema-setting mechanism?

note: schema changes with ZODBMutableProperties (as through MemberData) may not take place on all existing users
unless the server is restarted. (we could clear the ZCache to fix this.)

sheet.py has the MutablePropertySheet schema coded in for several basic types. is this all we need?

join_form manages to call addPropertySheet (probably through _findUser, through getUserById) like six times.
may be for Anonymous.

I've seen some strange lag on property updates on ZOGBMutablePropertyManager. Dunno if it'll repeat. A caching thing?

plugins.user.UserManager.addUser changes should go into PAS

Group properties on properties plugin, like member?

UI should be set to do listing of users/groups on a limited basis

listing of group-belonging by user broken

membership tool wrapUser stupidly uses roles attribute. we want it to use methods. until this is fixed,
role mapping is broken

LDAP: mapping for group-role not working yet

LDAP: default property mappings?

LDAP: ordering of property managers (and other plugins) to top

jcc:

 - PasswordResetTool needed for reset password thing

 - password reset and deletion UI needs to be determined by availability of plugins

 - does title not get to wrapped group?

 - fix MembershipTool.searchForMembers, MemberDataTool searchFulltextForMembers

 - prefs_group_details and prefs_group_edit don't need to be customized for Plone 2.1 versions after 29 Apr 2005

 - install: setupRoles?

 - how does member.getRoles work in GRUF? what permission should it be in PlonePAS?

 - memberarea quote needs to work right
